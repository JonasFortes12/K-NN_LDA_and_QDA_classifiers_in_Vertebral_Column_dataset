function y = majority_vote(labels)
  % MAJORITY_VOTE Determines the most frequent class label.
  %
  %   y = MAJORITY_VOTE(labels) returns the class label that appears
  %   most frequently in the input vector "labels".
  %
  %   This function is typically used in k-NN classification to assign
  %   a class to a new sample based on the labels of its k nearest neighbors.
  %
  %   Input:
  %     labels - Column or row vector containing class labels (numeric)
  %
  %   Output:
  %     y      - The class label with the highest frequency (mode)
  %
  %   Note:
  %     In case of a tie, the function returns the first class with
  %     the maximum count.

  counts = zeros(length(classes), 1);

  for i = 1:length(classes)
    counts(i) = sum(labels == classes(i));
